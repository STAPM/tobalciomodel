Version: 0.9.1
Author: Damon Morris
Maintainer: Damon Morris <d.j.morris@sheffield.ac.uk>
Description: Simulates the impact on the macroeconomy of changes in the demand
        for alcohol and tobacco, producing estimates of the effect on total output, gross
        value added (GVA), employment, and earnings. Uses input-output modelling techniques 
        to estimate the impact of hypothetical percentage changes in demand or of policy effects
        estimated using the Sheffield Tobacco and Alcohol Policy Model (STAPM). Breaks down 
        estimated economic impacts by sector.
